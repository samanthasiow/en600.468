the latest training took place late on monday on манхэттенской side of the east river .
" those whom i know several cops , and which drew on this case , said that their direct in zuccotti park , " said the man who spoke on condition of anonymity .
one of the reasons for secrecy was a lesson learned the city .

" correctly to make it when in the park is the fewest people , " he said .
floodlights and pre - recorded announcement , несущиеся blared from loudspeakers устрашили , it seems , many protesters .
police said that tents not touched until 1:45 a.m. , giving the protesters time to collect things .
but many journalists argue that they did n't see how the police , and that police treated them rudely .
when police went to the west through a pile of personal belongings antifiltration protesters , including bags , plastic mats and bags full of clothing , the health department followed the team , it was collecting what брошено .
the main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen camp , central park .
about 10 people in the epicenter of the camps сковали myself together holding hands .

school employees union , representing hundreds of staff , who lost seats in last month , plans to sue the city on wednesday , arguing that layoffs were not needed and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate influence on the school , where poor students .
six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other employees who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on october 7 , as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to their refusal to give access to medical city funds , managed workers ' groups , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 reported that they have the notice claims , department of education , warning that filed against him ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce the formal filing suit in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokesman for the city 's legal department , said the city is not seen the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on its specific provisions .
he points out that while the статен - island was not layoffs , but schools in upper east side or трибеки were little , 17 auxiliary workers in браунсвилле 23 schools lost seats in the district , brooklyn , and 46 in the south bronx , was forced to resign in districts 8 and 9 .
p.s. 36th 3,26 per cent was scrapped in budget this year , and it also lost money , when the city has changed the way of counting additional funding for each poor student , who is enrolled in school .

language may seem harmless , but still no discussion on libya was not easy .
kerry and mccain introduced a resolution in june , allows limited use of american forces in libya .
but the same day , when the bill failed in the house of representatives , the chamber also supported a proposal that would not cut funding for u.s. operations in libya .
resolution " admires the people of libya 's foreign affairs committee for his incredible bravery and formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanked the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners , who participated in military operations to protect the libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism . "
whether the new measures will receive full support of the council on foreign affairs or расколют legislators as june bill ?
представитель люгера said on monday that he has not yet seen the latest bill .
this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives , republican bob гудлатом ( virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or about anything else that will be on the plenary vote of congress this session .
поправка гудлата - just one of the 68 constitutional amendments , affecting a wide range of issues , which were made in this meeting .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment only in the house and much else about the " control federal spending . "
the budget control act , which passed in august , demanded that the house of representatives , and the senate voted for a balanced budget amendment .
in addition to the budget , some lawmakers want to limit the number of terms of members of congress , and house of representatives member jose serrano ( democrat ) , new york wants to abolish the limit of two terms for president .
amendment banning same - sex marriages already offer many years , and another banning burning the flag .
as were members of congress to offer amendments , they are not faster than in previous years .
this rate pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s , when members of congress , according to the library of the senate , regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years .
the latest amendment , which was adopted , the 27 - i - was approved by parliament in 1992 , but in congress it was actually in 1789 .

" we are not victims , " said brigadier general sean b. mcfarland , who commanded troops in iraq and soon left in afghanistan .
this is a very sensitive topic for commanders , who do not want to seem ungrateful or несогласными with society , which they serve .

some will look at them with admiration , because they smash the rebels and used in exotic locations .
while looking for work , he says , he felt that some interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible work immediately after the military campaign in washington .
uneasy that military experience , partly derives from american indifference to the wars .
" we , as a nation , no longer appreciate military heroism , as it was quite usual in world war ii , " says david бэрноу retired lieutenant general who commanded u.s. forces in afghanistan .

nevertheless , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to companies with big financial interests , was sufficient signal for activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign fundraising with lawyers , which now covers the court . "
scalia and thomas barely pay attention to critics who say they are quite willing to mix business with the court фигурирующими in groups like federalists .
moreover , conservatives argue that this is about justice elena kagan ethical question arises , rather than scalia and thomas .
her critics , demanded that kagan refused a hearing on this case because she was too involved in the protection of the law , then , to be impartial now .

former presidential candidate john edwards was indicted in financial fraud during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on exams in school and college is the norm .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes with each other .
in contrast to the games room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to detect lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
not worth of hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .
